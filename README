What if a complete, novel length story was written and edited by multiple people who have never met before?

Starting with a setup, readers will be able to determine what happens next to the story by writing their own portion. However, only one of the user submitted chapters will be officially adopted into the true story.

Do you consider yourself a poor or inexperienced writer, and don't wish to submit even if you have a great idea/direction/character for the story? Not a problem! The selected entry will be edited by the community; correcting and fixing grammars, spellnig misteaks, confusing imagery, extraordinarily gargantuan hyperboles, or run-on sentences! As any author will tell you, the first draft is never perfect.

This project is being made for an Independen Study at RIT, as I am a student there.
