"I'm so gritty and realisitc, I ate a rape/murder case for breakfast." Claimed the ironically-named Detective Smiles. He had no time to talk to the street vendor, even if he was there to buy food. Talking about his job usually made people clam up real fast. He was feeling particularly scowly because the economy was bad, not to mention his drinking problem. Almighty above, all during his divorce! Usually getting a fried kitten-on-a-stick made him feel a little better, but it wasn't doing it today. Taking a bite, he thought over his life, trying to determine where it all went wrong. Upon arriving back at the police department, he noticed the typo in the first sentence, and promptly fired the intern.
